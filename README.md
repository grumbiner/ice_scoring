# ice_scoring
Tools for model evaluation, primarily of sea ice models.

Now includes submodules
* SIDFEx https://github.com/helgegoessling/SIDFEx
* SITools https://github.com/XiaLinUCL/Sea-Ice-Evaluation-Tool
* DIAG_SUITE https://github.com/NeilBarton-NOAA/DIAG_SUITE

# Quick start for NCEP_si_verf:
* Build the executables:
  * first build the mmablib -- cd ../mmablib; make
  * In the ice_scoring main directory ./makeall.sh
* You'll also need the fixed files. Copy or use (ln -s):
  * WCOSS: /u/Robert.Grumbine/rgdev/fix
  * Hera:  /home/Robert.Grumbine/rg/fix
  * Gaea:  /home/Robert.Grumbine/rg/fix
* For gross checks, more detail in gross_checks/README
  * python3 gross_ice.py   NAME_OF_ICE.nc   ctl/ice.extremes   redone.dictionary
    * similarly for ocean.
  * there are a number of control (ctl) files, in order of least to highest frequency of output:
    * .extremes, .vvhigh, .vhigh, .high, .moderate

# NCEP_si_verf Contents:

## Directly skill-related:

* main -- main .csh and python scripts to carry out model verification

* drift -- ice drift skill metrics, oriented to the old drift model (sk2) using IABP for verification
  * these are relatively well-developed as metrics, see TN NNN, MMM for discussion

* concentration -- metrics for measuring skill in sea ice concentration fields, the whole field, not just the edge

* ice_edge -- find ice edge from an ice concentration analysis using transition
              against a tolerance
  * score a pair of ice edges
  * algorithms per discussions with Rick Allard (NRL) and Barbara Casati (ECCC)

* thickness -- to be intercomparisons on sea ice thickness

* integral
  * for ice area and extent, globally, hemispherically, and (in principle) within regions
  * integrated ice edge extent error (likewise, in principle)

* gross_checks -- check for structural problems (grid seams) or impossible values (e.g. SST < -3)


## Supportive:

* nulls   -- null forecasters

* exec    -- executables (not on git, generated by makeall.sh)

* formats -- brief demonstrations of decoding various input file types and formats

* legacy  -- archive of codes used in support of papers 1994-2017.

## Not in github:

* docs -- documents on ice model scoring
