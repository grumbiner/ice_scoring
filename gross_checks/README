Assemble tools for making automated checks for model output sanity.

Build on some sort of progression such that the checks make sense in a sequence.

Numerical artefact checks:
Tripolar seam?
Disk around pole divergent from rest of field?

Global range checks:
sss:        [0..41] (except some coastal points in sw persian gulf, which may reach 58!)
sst:        [-1.98..~35.0] C (might go below for a timestep -- A Mehra)
ice thick:  [0..5+] m, max should be > 1.5m arctic, > 1 antarctic
ice speed:  [0..0.7] m/s ,  rough -- Nansen rule equates 0.7 m/s ice motion to winds of 35 m/s

Regional/local range checks:
Arctic ocean
Southern ocean
Gulf of Mexico
Gulf Stream
ENSO 3.1 et al.
