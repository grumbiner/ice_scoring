This takes for its input 
1) a file with exceptions (ex: ignore, summary.exc, SSS)
2) the pm output from a gross check scan

and produces output of those values which aren't being granted an exception either because
the flagged (i.e. in pm) line is a parameter or area which is being ignored, it's a parameter in a location where the normal bound is inappropriate (e.g. the Persian Gulf gets extremely hot), or it's a known error
