This contains the sources for executing scoring on sea ice concentration.

While the executables can be built here, it is better to use the 
  makeall.sh script in the directory above

Also present are elementary python scripts to plot the results, as used 
  by the UFS S2S coupled project standard runs.

There are a number of specialized scoring programs (score_v_NNNN), but 
  I'm starting to make more generic ones, such that variable elements 
  (netcdf names, grid dimensions, ...) are read in (from a .def file) 
  rather than compiled in. Ensure that your definition is in runtime.def 
Contents of the .def file are:
NX (NX, NY are numeric values)
NY
Latitude (the rest of these are variable names, e.g. TLAT, TLON, tarea, aice, hi)
Longitude
tarea
ice concentration
ice thickness

Some very old thoughts:

Robert Grumbine October 2008

* Score where either model or obs report non-zero
* Score where both model and obs report non-zero
* Score where obs report nonzero
* Score everywhere ('everywhere')
* Score as above, but within selected domain(s)

Scores -- obs vs. fcst:
bias
rms
variance
index of agreement
correlation (+ regression a, b)
[vector correlation]
POD
FAR
(a11, a12, a21, a22) -- threat matrix
Murphy skill score


Scores -- obsd deviation from climo vs. fcst deviation from climo
bias
rms
variance
index of agreement
correlation (+ regression a, b)
[vector correlation]

Utility ----------------------------------------
Construct a climatology
Construct a null forecast
