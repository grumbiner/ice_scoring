To get the executables, go up to the main ice_scoring directory and execute
makeall.sh

Ensure that you have a link to the fixed files directory under your ice_scoring directory:
WCOSS:  /u/Robert.Grumbine/rgdev/fix/
Hera:   /home/Robert.Grumbine/rgdev/fix
Orion:  /home/rgrumbin/rgdev/fix

Gross checks and ice model scoring are currently run separately.

To run gross checks on ice or ocean (or, in principle, anything else with a .nc output)
    cd to gross_checks
    decide whether it is ice or ocean, a single file (gross) or an entire 
        forecast run (35 days, 6 hourly for the ocean 24 hourly at the 
        moment for the ice) you want to examine.
    select the level of verbosity you want (increasingly verbose going 
        from .extremes, .vvhigh, .vhigh, .high, .moderate) for the 
        diagnostic output (files in subdirectory ctl)
    If on hera, ensure you have /home/Robert.Grumbine/clim_data/anaconda3/bin in your path
    Then execute (further instructions in gross_checks/README)


Ice model scoring:
    export BASE=location_of_your_ice_scoring_directory (or setenv)
    Select a directory to save output in, cd to it.
    execute master/bootstrap.sh
    export EXDIR=`pwd` (or equivalent setenv)
    python3 platforms.py
      -- will be silent if you're on a known platform with at least some verification data
      -- otherwise, you'll need to add a machine to machines = { ... }, 
      --    and the corresponding paths for at least one of ims, ncep, or nsidc data 
    You'll need to edit the fname in functions fcst_name, get_fcst in file 
       verf_files.py to accord with your naming convention for ice model output files.
    Ditto file setup_verf_ice.py, function score_nsidc
    Edit all.csh for your paths:
       expt      -- tag for the experiment name
       FCST_BASE -- where the forecast output is
       EXDIR     -- as above EXDIR reference
       RUNBASE   -- place to execute the scoring
    Edit the foreach loops for yy, mm, dd to accord with your interest.
       -- approximately 24 forecasts of 35 days can be evaluated in 8 
              hours, 1 cpu, on hera
    Edit the references to the FCST_BASE in the if test and the python3 
       line to accord with path naming convention. Ex, with $initial 
       being an 8 digit date YYYYMMDD
           ${FCST_BASE}/$initial/6hrly/ 
           ${FCST_BASE}/gfs.$initial/6hrly/ 
           ${FCST_BASE}/$initial/00/ 
           ${FCST_BASE}/gfs.${initial}00/6hrly/ 
           ... or whatever is currently the case. The next element should 
       be files named as you edited verf_files.py and setup_verf_ice.py 
       to reference. 

    ... and, finally, run all.csh
    This will carry out the evaluations and put the results in subdirectories
        named out.YYYYMMDD, where YYYYMMDD is the initial date of the forecast.
    Results will include:
        out. files -- comments for each verifying date
        edge.fcst_VERIFYING_SOURCE.verifying_date ice edge files
        score.n.${valid_date}f${start_date}.csv (comma separated threat 
           scores for the valid_date on a forecast from start_date, at 
           each threat level [0., 0.95, by 0.05]
        threat_$lead_from_$start.png ($lead days from $start, showing all critical levels)
        threat_$lvl_f$start.png (all leads, threat for given $lvl -- 
           argument to contingency.py in all.csh, currently 0.15)
