1) Run trial.csh from/for the model of interest.
  ufs_ice    -- quarter degree UFS ice
  ufs_ocean  -- quarter degree UFS ocean
  rtofs      -- rtofs direct outputs
  rtofs_cice -- cice output from rtofs
  cice       -- consortium standard runs
  jra        -- JRA 55 ocean reanalysis on cice consortium grids
  giops      -- canadian Global ice-ocean prediction system

0) Supporting directories:
  shared   -- python modules shared by all gross checkers
  curves   -- bounding curves for regions. Vague connection to IHO regions.
              currently includes both regions named by IHO and regions
              constructed for physical exceptions (ex: The Red Sea can 
              be much more saline than most of the ocean) or known errors 
              (UFS P7 and earlier had exceptional snow thicknesses in Weddell Sea)  
  ctl      -- limit files, while often named for a model they should, in 
              principle, be of general use. Lack of generality comes from: 
              a) models changing names of the parameters 
              b) model resolution -- fine resolution models can properly have more extreme values

2) Further processing
  exceptions/ -- exceptions.py and support --> given original scan for 
                 gross errors, thin the output by applying known exceptions: 
                 a) Parameters to ignore for now (ex. ignore.params)
                 b) Parts of the world to ignore (ex. ignore.tropics)
                 c) Physical exceptions (Red Sea is very salty)
                 d) Known model errors (UFS likes to put too much snow in the southern Weddell Sea)
   -- While (currently) only one exception file can be applied at a time, the output of one
      run of exceptions.py can be used as input to the next.


  plot_errs.py -- takes name of a gross errors file as first argument and a figure label as second,
                  produces plots of the locations of error points in both ij space and lat-lon space.
                  _very_ rough
