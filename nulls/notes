IMS, NCEP analy, NSIDC analy, forecast (CICE5, RTOFS+CICE4, CFSV2, ...)

(For each):
get file
open + translate to binary
find ice edge of file


score ice edges -- persistence, vs. IMS
integral area, extent by hemisphere


fcst:
gross checks

null forecast of extent


Robert Grumbine October 2008

* Score where either model or obs report non-zero
* Score where both model and obs report non-zero
* Score where obs report nonzero
* Score everywhere ('everywhere')
* Score as above, but within selected domain(s)

Scores -- obs vs. fcst:
bias
rms
variance
index of agreement
correlation (+ regression a, b)
[vector correlation]
POD
FAR
(a11, a12, a21, a22) -- threat matrix
Murphy skill score


Scores -- obsd deviation from climo vs. fcst deviation from climo
bias
rms
variance
index of agreement
correlation (+ regression a, b)
[vector correlation]

Utility ----------------------------------------
Construct a climatology
Construct a null forecast
