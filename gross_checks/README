Assemble tools for making automated checks for model output sanity.

First (functioning) tools:
gross_ice.py
gross_ocean.py

Preface:
  You need python3 in your path. The hera install is not sufficient, though the wcoss is.
On WCOSS: module load python/3.6.3
On Hera: add /home/Robert.Grumbine/rgdev/anaconda3 to your PATH

Usage:
python3 gross_ice.py NAME_OF_ICE.nc ice.dictionary redone.dictionary
python3 gross_ocean.py NAME_OF_OCEAN.nc ocean.dictionary redone.dictionary

The first listed dictionaries on the command line contain the names of 
  netcdf parameters in the file and, optionally, 4 numbers -- global minimum, 
  global maximum, highest allowed minimum, lowest allowed maximum.
For any parameter that is name only, the file 'redone.dictionary' will 
  contain parameter name plus observed min, max and estimated highest 
  minimum and lowest maximum.
Any parameter which is listed, but not in the .nc, will give a message to stdout, e.g.:
  rain_h  not in data file 
  -- and execution will proceed without it.

Examining output:
If any value for a parameter on its grid violates the given limits, you'll get a message like:
    hi_h        excessively high maximum  6.14912  versus  5.0  allowed
where the 6.14 is in the grid, and you said 5.0 was the highest allowed value. Otherwise, 
it is silent.

For parameters which exceed the global bounds anywhere, a second pass is made which prints out where and the values:
parameter i j longitude tlatitude model_value test_checked test_value
hi_h 1112 901 338.49753 70.645 5.4321904  vs pmax  5.0
hi_h 1111 907 338.3247 71.2918 6.14912  vs pmax  5.0
hi_h 1110 909 338.0922 71.51021 5.651512  vs pmax  5.0
hi_h 1046 1018 312.75015 83.079865 5.1349816  vs pmax  5.0





Notes towards the future: --------------

Build on some sort of progression such that the checks make sense in a sequence.

Numerical artefact checks:
Tripolar seam?
Disk around pole divergent from rest of field?


Regional/local range checks:
Arctic ocean
Southern ocean
Gulf of Mexico
Gulf Stream
Nino 3.4, etc.
