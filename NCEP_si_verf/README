I'm using this as a catch-all for sea ice model skill measure files.

Quick start:
* To build the executables:
first build the mmablib -- cd ../mmablib; make
In the NCEP_si_verf directory ./makeall.sh

* You'll also need the fixed files (binaries).
  * WCOSS: /u/Robert.Grumbine/rgdev/fix
  * Hera:  /home/Robert.Grumbine/rg/fix
  * Gaea:  /home/Robert.Grumbine/rg/fix

* For gross checks, more detail in gross_checks/README
  * python3 gross_ice.py   NAME_OF_ICE.nc   ctl/ice.extremes   redone.dictionary
    * similarly for ocean.
  * there are a number of control (ctl) files, in order of least to highest frequency of output:
    * .extremes, .vvhigh, .vhigh, .high, .moderate



Contents:

Directly skill-related:

main_dir  -- main shell and python scripts to carry out model verification

Components of verification:

drift -- ice drift skill metrics, oriented to the old drift model (sk2) 
           using IABP for verification
      ---- these are relatively well-developed as metrics, see TN NNN, MMM for discussion

concentration -- metrics for measuring skill in sea ice concentration fields, 
                   the whole field, not just the edge
 
ice_edge -- find ice edge from an ice concentration analysis using transition 
              against a tolerance
         -- score a pair of ice edges
         -- algorithms per discussions with Rick Allard (NRL) and Barbara Casati (ECCC)

thickness -- to be intercomparisons on sea ice thickness

integral -- for ice area and extent, within regions



Supportive:
exec    -- executables (not on git)

fix      -- fixed files of use (not on git) 
-- binary files not on github. Copy or use (ln -s)
WCOSS: /u/Robert.Grumbine/rg/fix
Hera: /home/Robert.Grumbine/rg/fix
Gaea: /home/Robert.Grumbine/rg/fix
 
formats -- brief demonstrations of decoding various input file types and formats

nulls -- null forecasters

legacy -- archive of codes used in support of papers 1994-2017.

docs -- documents (not on git)
