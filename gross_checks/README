Assemble tools for making automated checks for model output sanity.

First (functioning) tools:
gross_ice.py
gross_ocean.py
wholesale_ocean.py -- examine all 35 days, 6 hourly, surface fields from a forecast ocean
wholesale_ice.py   -- examine all 35 days, 6 hourly, surface fields from a forecast ice
delta_ice.py       -- examine differences between two ice runs

Preface:
On WCOSS: module load python/3.6.3
On Orion: module load python/3.7.5
  The hera python modules are not sufficient, so you'll need:
On Hera: prepend /home/Robert.Grumbine/clim_data/anaconda3/bin to your PATH
On Hera you might also need to add:
  setenv TERMINFO /usr/share/terminfo
to your .cshrc

Usage:
python3 gross_ice.py   NAME_OF_ICE.nc   ice.dictionary   redone.dictionary
python3 gross_ocean.py NAME_OF_OCEAN.nc ocean.dictionary redone.dictionary

The first listed dictionaries on the command line contain the names of 
  netcdf parameters in the file and, optionally, 4 numbers -- global minimum, 
  global maximum, highest allowed minimum, lowest allowed maximum.
For any parameter that is name only, the file 'redone.dictionary' will 
  contain parameter name plus observed min, max and estimated highest 
  minimum and lowest maximum.
Any parameter which is listed, but not in the .nc, will give a message to stdout, e.g.:
  rain_h  not in data file 
  -- and execution will proceed without it.

*.extremes gives bounds that are seldom exceeded in 6 years of prototype runs, 
  for the named (*) files

Examining output:
If any value for a parameter on its grid violates the given limits, you'll get a message like:
    hi_h        excessively high maximum  6.14912  versus  5.0  allowed
where the 6.14 is in the grid, and you said 5.0 was the highest allowed 
  value. Otherwise, it is silent.

For parameters which exceed the global bounds anywhere, a second pass 
  is made which prints out where and the values:
parameter i j longitude tlatitude model_value test_checked test_value
hi_h 1112 901 338.49753 70.645 5.4321904  vs pmax  5.0
hi_h 1111 907 338.3247 71.2918 6.14912  vs pmax  5.0
hi_h 1110 909 338.0922 71.51021 5.651512  vs pmax  5.0
hi_h 1046 1018 312.75015 83.079865 5.1349816  vs pmax  5.0





Notes towards the future: --------------

Build on some sort of progression such that the checks make sense in a sequence.

Grid edge effects/checks:
i = 0, nx; j = 0, ny

Numerical artefact checks:
Tripolar seam?
Disk around pole divergent from rest of field?


Regional/local range checks:
Arctic ocean
Southern ocean
Gulf of Mexico
Gulf Stream
Nino 3.4, etc.
