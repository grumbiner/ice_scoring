exceptions.py -- takes for its input:
1) a file with exceptions (ex: ignore, known.errors, physical.exceptions)
2) output from a gross check scan

and produces output of those values which aren't being granted an exception either because
the flagged (i.e. in pm) line is a parameter or area which is being ignored, it's a parameter in a location where the normal bound is inappropriate (e.g. the Persian Gulf gets extremely hot), or it's a known error -- whatever conditions are being allowed


Exception control files: --------------------------------------------
Note: More efficient if most common exceptions are listed first.

* ignore.params -- parameters to ignore (even if present, don't bother about them for now)

* physical.exceptions -- parameters and regions which may exceed normal bounds for acceptable physical reasons (e.g. the Persian Gulf can be hot and salty)

* known.errors -- per name. Ideally this file goes to size 0

* ignore.tropics -- per name. Would be better to have parm = all to ignore all parameters in the region.
