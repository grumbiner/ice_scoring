I'm using this as a catch-all for sea ice model skill measure files.

Quick start:
* To build the executables:
first build the mmablib -- cd ../mmablib; make
In the ice_scoring main directory ./makeall.sh
* You'll also need the fixed files (binaries).


Contents:

Directly skill-related:

master -- master .csh and python scripts to carry out model verification

drift -- ice drift skill metrics, oriented to the old drift model (sk2) 
           using IABP for verification
      ---- these are relatively well-developed as metrics, see TN NNN, MMM for discussion

concentration -- metrics for measuring skill in sea ice concentration fields, 
                   the whole field, not just the edge
 
ice_edge -- find ice edge from an ice concentration analysis using transition 
              against a tolerance
         -- score a pair of ice edges
         -- algorithms per discussions with Rick Allard (NRL) and Barbara Casati (ECCC)

thickness -- to be intercomparisons on sea ice thickness

integral -- for ice area and extent, within regions



Supportive:
exec    -- executables (not on git)

fix      -- fixed files of use (not on git) 

gross_checks -- check for structural problems (grid seams) or impossible values ( T < -3)

docs -- documents on ice model scoring

formats -- brief demonstrations of decoding various input file types and formats

legacy -- archive of codes used in support of papers 1994-2017.

sidfex  -- Sea Ice Dynamics Forecast Experiment support files/scripts

web -- towards web display of scores
