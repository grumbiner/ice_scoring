Score sea ice drift model guidance against IABP data or IFREMER satellite analyzed drift.
Most is the C++ methods using mmablib.  

The exception is iceDriftskill.py developed by Victor Ogunbamiwo.

The codes are aimed for a context where many months (years) of observations
have accumulated and all the ice drift model forecasts will be scored.  The
scores shared to the web follow the recommendation of 5 from Grumbine 201NN.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
## Common regardless of source:
make
File forecast.points gives the lat-long of the standard 207 'skiles points'.
concatenate all IABP 'C' files you're interested in scoring model for in to dboydata

  IABP Flow:
    edit score.sh to point to your IABPDIR and FORECASTDIR, and your matchup 
        range, time window, years of interest
  
  IFREMER Flow:
    edit range.sh to point to your IFREMER directories otherwise, as IABP
    afterwards, run iscore on the match files (concatenated how you like) 


Common:
scripts end with splityear.pl to parcel out results by year, will 
               include size 0 files for any years not scored from years 1998-2018

Will finish with directories kmNN.N (NN.N = the RADIUS you specified) 
  and kmNN.N.YY (where YY = the years you specified)
Inside each will be a file called score.XXXXX 
  each will contain scores for (its year, if a year directory): 
    * all matchups, for all buoys, all skiles points, all lead times
    * all matchups by lead  (all months, etc.)
    * all matchups by month (all lead, etc.)
    * all matchups by skiles point and lead (all months, etc.)

Updating Web (after having prior scores computed):
  scoretoweb.sh (will invoke scoretoweb.pl)


Unused? -- range.sh
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes: 
* The IABP slow step is 'avg2', which takes about 4 minutes per year of buoy data.
    iabpcheck and score are a matter of seconds.

* The ifremer process is much quicker
