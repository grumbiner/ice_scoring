exceptions.py -- takes for its input 
1) a file with exceptions (ex: ignore, summary.exc, SSS)
2) output from a gross check scan

and produces output of those values which aren't being granted an exception either because
the flagged (i.e. in pm) line is a parameter or area which is being ignored, it's a parameter in a location where the normal bound is inappropriate (e.g. the Persian Gulf gets extremely hot), or it's a known error -- whatever conditions are being allowed

scatter.py -- doesn't work, yet.
-- _will_ take as argument the output from above (or a gross check) and produce a scatter plot


Exception control files:
Note: More efficient if most common exceptions are listed first.

* ignore.params -- file with some parameters to ignore (even if present, don't bother about them for now)

* physical.exceptions -- file with parameters and regions which may exceed normal bounds for acceptable physical reasons
